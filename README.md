# Welcome to this README! #

This repository contains **my final work of the Statistical Models** (Modelos Estadísticos) course in my BSc Mathematics in June 2020.
This work consists of the **analysis of the contagion of COVID-19** in the Comunidad Valenciana during the State of Alarm for the management
of possible future outbreaks.

I used the following **IT tools** to carry it out:

* Excel (to clean data)
    * _Note that, nowadays, I would clean and select interesting data using MySQL._
* R (to handle data and draw conclusions)
* LaTeX (to present the study and the final results)

Thus, in order to replicate the results obtained throughout this study, I add the **(clean) datasets in XLS** of the number of COVID-19 infections
in the three provinces of Comunidad Valenciana (Castellón, Valencia and Alicante), the **code written in R** to verify that the results are true
and the **final report in PDF format**.
